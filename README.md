# Simple PyQt5 Stopwatch

A simple and accurate stopwatch application built using Python and the PyQt5 GUI framework. This project demonstrates basic GUI development with PyQt5, including timer management, signal and slot connections, and custom styling.

## Features

- **Start/Stop Functionality:** Easily start and pause the timer with a dedicated button.
- **Precise Timing:** Tracks time with millisecond precision, ensuring high accuracy.
- **Reset Button:** Instantly resets the timer to zero.
- **Clean UI:** The user interface is designed with a modern, minimalist style for readability and ease of use.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.12
- PyQt5

## How to Run

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KaungKhant09/PyQt5_Stopwatch.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd PyQt5_Stopwatch
    ```
3.  **Install PyQt5:**
    If you don't have PyQt5 installed, you can install it using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install PyQt5
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python stopwatch_app.py
    ```

## Future Improvements

- **Add Lap/Split Functionality:** Allow users to record and display lap times.
- **Persistent Timing:** Implement a feature to save the stopwatch state (e.g., the elapsed time) when the application is closed.
- **Customizable UI:** Allow users to change the color scheme or font size.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Add keyboard controls for start, stop, and reset.
